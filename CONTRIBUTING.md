# Contributing to Rilla

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Rilla! Itâ€™s people like you that make open source great. This document will guide you through setting up your development environment and making your first contribution.

## 1. Prerequisites

Before you begin, please make sure you have the following software installed:
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Python 3.10+](https://www.python.org/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (Recommended)
- A [GitHub Account](https://github.com/)

## 2. Initial Setup: Fork, Clone, and Configure

To work on Rilla, you will need your own copy of the repository.

### Step 2.1: Fork the Repository
Fork the `rilla-org/rilla-core` repository by clicking the "Fork" button in the top-right corner of the GitHub page. This creates a copy of the project under your own GitHub account.

### Step 2.2: Clone Your Fork
Clone your fork to your local machine. We strongly recommend using SSH for cloning.
- [Configuring an SSH key for GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)
```bash
git clone git@github.com:YOUR-USERNAME/rilla-core.git
cd rilla-core
```

### Step 2.3: Set up GPG for Signed Commits
Our project requires all commits to be cryptographically signed to verify their origin.
- [Generating a new GPG key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/generating-a-new-gpg-key)
- [Adding the GPG key to your GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/adding-a-new-gpg-key-to-your-github-account)
- [Telling Git about your signing key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/telling-git-about-your-signing-key)

### Step 2.4: Configure your Git Email
To avoid privacy errors when pushing, configure your local Git to use your GitHub-provided `noreply` email. You can find this in your [GitHub email settings](https://github.com/settings/emails).
```bash
git config --global user.email "ID+username@users.noreply.github.com"
##3. Setting Up the Python Environment
We use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

```Bash
# Create the virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it (Windows)
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# Activate it (macOS/Linux)
source venv/bin/activate

# Install the required libraries
pip install PySide6
```
## 4. Running the Application
Once set up, you can run the application from the root directory of the project:
code
```Bash
python src/main.py
```
## 5. The Development Workflow
All changes must be made through branches and pull requests.
1. Create a Branch: Create a new branch for your feature or bugfix.
2. Commit Your Changes: Make your changes and commit them with a clear message.
3. Push Your Branch: Push the branch to your fork on GitHub.
4. Open a Pull Request: From your fork on GitHub, open a pull request to the main branch of `rilla-org/rilla-core.`
